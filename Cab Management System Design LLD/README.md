### Cab Management System

This is a C++ implementation of a simple Cab Management System. The system allows you to manage cabs, their locations, and availability efficiently.

#### Features

- Add new cabs to the system.
- Remove existing cabs from the system.
- Update the location of a cab.
- Toggle the availability of a cab.
- Find the nearest available cab to a given location.

#### Usage

1. Compile the source code (`main.cpp`) using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the Cab Management System.

### Classes

#### `Cab`

Represents a single cab with the following attributes:

- `id`: Unique identifier of the cab.
- `available`: Indicates whether the cab is available for service.
- `location`: Current location of the cab represented as (x, y) coordinates.

#### `CabManagementSystem`

Manages multiple cabs and provides functionalities to manipulate them, including:

- Adding new cabs.
- Removing existing cabs.
- Updating cab locations.
- Toggling cab availability.
- Finding the nearest available cab to a given location.

#### File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program demonstrating the usage of the Cab Management System.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

#### Dependencies

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
